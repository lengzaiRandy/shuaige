    <p>hello randy.</p>
    <p>How many people do you trust nowadays? How often do you have sympathy for someone? There shouldn’t be an answer. Don’t trust anyone. Don’t look deep into someone’s desperate eyes and see their soul wail help. No matter how melancholy, enraged, or ashamed. Don’t aid them back to health. You know why? Because that person has a 67% chance of being a clone. Copy and pasted. So you, reading this story, are blessed you aren’t a clone yet. You’re not one of them. Yet.
        Approximately three years ago, Dr Quintendo III, a mental scientist, had managed to turn a typical computer to life.<br>Which meant he would be capable of thrusting objects into a computer screen, and you would observe it ambushed inside the screen. He would lure you into his basement by bribing you with money, food, or really anything they were struggling with. Then, he would push you into the screen, get his mouse and click copy and paste. How did Dr Quintendo create this great invention? No one knows. No one knows what’s running inside a mental person’s head. Especially since Dr Quintendo III was mute. His opinions and wacky thoughts weren’t claimed. No one had the indications to stop him because they all thought he was a purely honest man. You would think that you would get used to being mute. But no. Quintendo had bottled up all of these immense feelings, and to get vengeance on these narcissistic outsiders. He would replace amiable people who attempted to comfort him but instead offended with a clone. These clones hurt people feelings. These clones were going to help Quintendo do things to people what they did to him. These clones were his new best friends.
        He had clones of his parents, teachers, neighbours, and friends.<br> But what did he do with these innocent victims? They were his assistants. Foot massages, watered plants, and bills were at the tip of his fingers. Every time he asked for a favour, he would bribe them with going back to their normal lives. But obviously, that wasn’t the case. Even though the assistants knew every time he would bribe them with going back to their usual lives, he wouldn’t, they were still threatened with the thought of what he was going to do. Faithfully, on the 4th of August, 2016, a new victim was brought into his home. While Quintendo was asking the assistant to clean out the basement, she had asked him if he wanted an air freshener, and while she was at it, she pushed him into the computer screen, got the mouse and clicked delete.
        Dr Quintendo III was then to be trapped inside the computer for the rest of his life. Because of him, he made the world the worst place to be in. Because of him, he had contrived bullies. Because of him, he contrived fear.
